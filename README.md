# ChARseq-2022
Python wrapper code to Analyze ChARseq datasets, identify RNA/DNA contacts, generate heatmaps, and identify local contacts within specified features.

Code is executed from jupyter lab notebooks (.ipynb). CharSeqPipelineFour is written in Python 3.

The bridge was identified and removed from these SE reads using modified scripts (char_bridge_trackall_simple.py, and charbridgetools.py) from (Bell et al. 2018, https://github.com/straightlab/flypipe). These scripts are written in Python 2.
